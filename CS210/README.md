# Bike-Sharing-Project-

In this project, we tried to figure out how number of casual and registered bike users change during specific conditions. Furthermore, with the help of these findings about how number of registered and casual users changes under specific conditions, we tried to predict the number of registered/casual users for forthcoming days. We utilized machine learning methods such as regression, KNN and random forest for this task. To elaborate more, we looked for factors that affect the number of registered bike users and casual bike users (By exploring the Data and Plotting Graphs). For example, we guess that most of the registered users are workers that use bikes to go to their work. By the hourly data of the bike sharing, we could see this factor more clearly. Furthermore, weather is a crucial factor for casual bike users because we guess that if the weather is clear, people would be more likely to casually rent a bike. With the help of the weather and casual bike users’ data in the dataset, we can show clearly if this guess is true or not. To conclude, this approach to the dataset is very important as we could understand the motivations behind renting a bike, both for registered and casual users. In addition, predicting the number of registered and casual users for a day or hour would be very beneficial both for company and customers because company would optimize their number of available bikes for a day or they would revise their registrations plans etc. Customers would benefit from this improvements as it will be easier to find bikes.

I have a 3d cube object in my hand. I'm going to give you a list of transformations you 
should apply to this cube. Please calculate the final modelview matrix and return it in float32array format by using js. 
The transformations:
	translation:
		0.3 units in x-axis
		-0.25 units in y-axis
	scaling:
		0.5 by x-axis
		0.5 by y-axis
	rotation:
		30 degrees on x-axis
		45 degrees on y-axis
		60 degrees on z-axis

Return format should be in js:
	 const transformationMatrix = new Float32Array([
        
    	]);
Please calculate the result by yourself and return the Float32AArray

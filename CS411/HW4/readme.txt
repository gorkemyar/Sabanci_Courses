For the questions 1,2,3,4, and 5, I created python files to solve the given questions.
The files are named as hw04_questionX.py where X denotes the number of question.
To run the files you can use a python editor or simply write the following line in the terminal with python.

	python hw04_questionX.py
		or
	python3 hw04_questionX.py

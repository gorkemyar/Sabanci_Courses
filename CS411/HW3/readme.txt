For the questions 1,2,4,5 and 6, I created python files to solve the given questions.
The files are named as hw03_questionX.py where X denotes the number of question.
To run the files you can use a python editor or simply write the following line in the terminal with python.

	python hw01_questionX.py

		or
	python3 hw01_questionX.py

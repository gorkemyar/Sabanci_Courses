# Computer-Networks-Project

## Description:

In this project, we created a socket programming application with a server side and client sides. 
The project is a game project in which there are questions that have been asked by server and answered by the clients.
There should at least 2 client in any given time of the game in order to game continue. If there are less then 2 clients, 
server will automatically stops the game and the remaining client wins the game. On the other hand, if there are multiple number of clients 
that answered the last question, then client will calculate the scores of the clients and will announce the winner.

## Approaches:

We used some c# language to complete this project apart from that we tried to implement our project in a object oriented programing way.

To run codes:
1. Open terminal
2. Change directory to the phase2 folder
3. Run the command "make all" to compile all executables code
4. For CPU you have two options: ./skipperexe and ./sparyserexe
    - You can run either of them in the following way:
    - ./skipperexe matrix_name thread_count or ./sparyserexe matrix_name thread_count
    - Example: "./sparyserexe ../data/ey35_02.mat 16"
5. For GPU you have two options: ./skipperexecu and ./sparyserexecu
    - You can run either of them in the following way:
    - ./skipperexecu matrix_name gpu_count or ./sparyserexecu matrix_name gpu_count
    - Example: "./sparyserexe ../data/ey35_02.mat 2"
    - Gpu count can be either 1 or 2
6. The output will be displayed on the terminal

7. main and maincu files help you to run two algorithms simultaneosly, you can use them they also get the same inputs:
    - ./main matrix_name thread_count
    - ./maincu matrix_name gpu_count

To run all matrices with all algorithms simply run ./script   


The leaderboard results are the best performance results for each matrix.
- The CPU results of the football, bcspwr01 and chesapeake (these matrices are 0-1 matrices) matrices are obtained from the ./skipperexe algorithm. 
- Additionally, GPU results of the bcspwr01 is also obtained from ./skipperexecu algorithm. 
- Also, the results of the GD98\_a matrix (its permanent is 0) obtained via preprocessing not by either of the algorithms. 
- All of the other results come from the ./sparyserexe and ./sparyserexecu algorithms.
